# puca_tix

This script takes scraped data of PucaPoint promoted trade offers on MTGO tix and creates a simple graph of their history. Whether or not the user could fully pay for all their promoted trades was ignored.

The "10" line in tix.png represents the marginal price if 10 tix were bought, and the "100" line represents the marginal price if 100 tix were bought.
