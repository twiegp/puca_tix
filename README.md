# puca_tix

This script takes scraped data of PucaPoint bonus offers on MTGO tix and creates a simple graph of their history. The exact scraping method was to look at the names of all users who were asking for tix and seeing which ones had names that included percentages - it was assume that this percentage represented the bounty being offered. Imperfect but not terrible either.
